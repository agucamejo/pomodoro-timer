# Overview
Pomodoro Timer is a simple and intuitive timer application designed to help you stay focused while studying or working. It follows the Pomodoro Technique, which uses 25-minute focus intervals followed by 5-minute breaks. The timer is customizable, allowing you to set the intervals according to your needs, and it alerts you with a sound when the time is up, ensuring you make the most of your focus and break periods.

## Features
- **Customizable Intervals**: Set your own focus and break intervals to suit your workflow.
- **Simple and Intuitive Design**: Enjoy a clean and user-friendly interface that makes it easy to start and manage your timer.
- **Alarm Notifications**: Receive sound alerts when your focus or break time is over, helping you stay on track.

## How It Works
Set your desired focus and break intervals, start the timer, and begin your work or study session. The timer will alert you with a sound when it's time to take a break or get back to work, ensuring you maintain a balanced and productive routine.

## Technologies Used
